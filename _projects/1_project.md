## Transforming Local Payments: Our Hackathon Journey

During an exhilarating hackathon, our team tackled three pivotal challenges aimed at revolutionizing local payments and enhancing user experiences. Here’s a story of how we approached each issue and the innovative solutions we developed.

### Challenge 1: Enhancing Local Payments with Offline QR and NFC

We were tasked with making QR payment systems as convenient and swift as Apple Pay, while also ensuring they worked offline. The existing method required users to unlock their phones, open an app, and locate their QR code – a process taking at least 10 seconds. This was far from ideal, especially for those in a rush or stuck in long queues.

**Our Solution**: We developed an NFC-based payment system that bypassed Google and Apple Pay. For our demo, we programmed a Samsung device to act as a POS terminal. When it detected an iPhone with Apple Pay enabled, it displayed a successful transaction on the screen, demonstrating the feasibility of our solution. This approach reduced the transaction time to under a second, vastly improving the user experience.

### Challenge 2: Accelerating Customer Conversion to the m10 Platform

The next challenge was to create a comprehensive plan to transition a large customer base to the m10 platform. Our goal was to design a scalable, user-friendly approach that incentivized customers to switch to m10, leveraging all available terminals.

**Our Solution**: We revamped their existing app by integrating a dynamic map that showcased various businesses, both small and large, where users could see where to shop and the cashback offers available. We also enhanced the cashback system using AI to analyze user spending habits, providing personalized cashback offers. For instance, if a user frequently dines out, they would receive higher cashback for restaurants. This tailored approach made the app more user-friendly and attractive, encouraging users to spend more through the m10 platform.

### Challenge 3: Navigating the Acquisition of Micro and SME Segments

Our final challenge was to find value propositions for micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs, reducing their reliance on cash transactions.

**Our Solution**: With the first two challenges addressed, we anticipated an increase in daily app usage. This would, in turn, attract more businesses to join the platform. To support these businesses, we developed a business app within the existing platform. This tool allowed businesses to track their income and provided insights into how our app was helping them attract more customers and increase their revenue. By demonstrating tangible benefits, we made it easier for micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs to see the value of joining the m10 ecosystem.

### Conclusion

Throughout this hackathon, our team was driven by the goal of creating solutions that were not only innovative but also practical and user-centric. By enhancing payment systems, making the m10 platform more attractive to users, and providing valuable tools for businesses, we aimed to create a seamless, efficient, and rewarding payment ecosystem. This journey was a testament to the power of teamwork, creativity, and a shared vision for a better future in local payments.

    The myCobot 280 PI robotic arm automates dataset creation by mimicking human hand movements. Cameras capture images of labels on motorized rewinders, simulating real-world motion. This setup reduces manual effort while ensuring consistency for object detection tasks. A companion iPhone app (shown below) enables real-time model inference in the field.

## Overview

As a **Machine Learning Engineer** at **Zortag**, I automated dataset generation, optimized object detection models, and deployed an **iPhone app for real-time inference**. Zortagâ€™s 3D QR code technology demands high-accuracy authentication, and this project integrated robotics, computer vision, and mobile development to streamline the pipeline.

**Key Components**:

- Robotic arm automation for scalable data collection
- YOLOv8 fine-tuning (99.84% accuracy)
- Synthetic data generation
- **iPhone app** for on-device model inference (_video demo at the beginning_)

**Note**: Code and datasets are proprietary.

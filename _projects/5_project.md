## Freshman Robotics Project: Innovating with Arduino and Robotics

During my freshman year in Mechanical Engineering, I embarked on an exciting project that involved designing and constructing two distinct robots. The first robot was engineered to open a cola can and pour its contents into a waiting cup, showcasing precision mechanical design and operational efficiency.

The second robot represented a significant leap in complexity. Designed for autonomous drink delivery, it featured advanced sensory capabilities to scan its surroundings and detect nearby individuals. Utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, we programmed the robot to integrate an ultrasonic sensor for precise distance measurement and an H-bridge for motor control. The robot then autonomously calculated the shortest path to the nearest person using the Pythagorean theorem and navigated in straight lines to deliver the beverage with precision.

This project not only refined my technical skills but also imparted invaluable lessons in problem-solving, teamwork, and project management. It served as a pivotal experience that ignited my passion for robotics and engineering innovation.

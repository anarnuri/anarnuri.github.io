## Why This Will Change How You Work

### üí∏ Actually Free (Not "Free Trial")

I've optimized the system to run on minimal AWS credits:

- Free tier covers 90% of personal use cases
- Only if we hit heavy traffic (like 10,000+ users) might I add optional donations
- No feature paywalls - what you see is what you get

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Finds What You'd Never Think to Search

Traditional search fails when you don't know the exact terms. My AI:

1. Understands the **meaning** behind your question
2. Finds **related concepts** you didn't think to search
3. Gives **direct answers** instead of page numbers

_Try asking:_  
"Explain this technical section like I'm 15"  
"What are the risks mentioned in this report?"

### üåê Works Anywhere

- Browser-based (no install needed)
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Lightweight enough for slow connections

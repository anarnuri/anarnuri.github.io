    abstract = "{In recent years, there has been a strong interest in applying machine learning techniques to path synthesis of linkage mechanisms. However, progress has been stymied due to a scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising nearly three million samples of four-, six-, and eight-bar linkage mechanisms with open and closed coupler curves. Current machine learning approaches to path synthesis also lack standardized metrics for evaluating outcomes. To address this gap, we propose six key metrics to quantify results, providing a foundational framework for researchers to compare new models with existing ones. We also present a Variational AutoEncoder based model in conjunction with a k-nearest neighbor search approach to demonstrate the utility of our dataset. In the end, we provide example mechanisms that generate various curves along with numerical evaluation of the proposed metrics.}",

  abstract = {This paper analyzes via the size effect method, the induced anisotropy in the fracturing behavior of 3D printed parts made using Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (commonly abbreviated as ABS). The aspects of fracturing behavior considered include the strength, fracture toughness, the nonlinear fracture process zone (FPZ) size, and the degree of quasibrittleness. 3D printed ABS specimens of various sizes and various relative orientations of the pre-crack and the 3D printed layers are considered. The fracture properties are measured via fracture tests on single edge notch bending specimens. The measurements are seen to conform to the well-known size effect laws for strength and fracture toughness. It is demonstrated that the 3D printed parts exhibit considerable anisotropy in their fracturing behavior, which would not occur in the monolithic counterparts. This occurs not only for the strength and fracture toughness, but also the FPZ size and therefore the degree of quasibrittleness. The anisotropy stems from the crack path direction relative to the stacking direction of macrolayers and microlayers within a layer. The results show that these effects must be given due consideration when developing reliable designs for additively manufactured parts.},

      description:
        - Designed four multi-modal generative models for path synthesis in mechanical engineering:
            - Transformer-based model with LLaMa2 features and MLP for mechanism
              type prediction.
            - Conditional beta VAE with cross-attention mechanisms, integrated
              conditions, and Classifier Free Guidance.
            - Conditional graph-VAE model with Classifier Free Guidance.
            - Image-based VAE and MLP for mapping between latent space and
              mechanism representation.
        - Implemented object detection algorithms and post-processing techniques
          for sketch conversion by fine-tuning YOLOv4.
        - Led end-to-end research projects, including dataset creation, data
          preprocessing, model validation, and augmentation.
        - Demonstrated deep expertise in neural network architectures, loss
          functions, and data manipulation tools including PyTorch (Lightning),
          NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
        - Managed dataset updates via Kaggle and utilized online GPU services
          (Lambda, VAST.AI). Worked with Linux, CUDA and presented work at
          annual ASME conferences in 2021 - 2023.

I come from a Mechanical Engineering background, holding both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Stony Brook University. During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at two start-up companies, Chem3 and Flower Turbines, as well as the international giant BP, working as a mechanical engineer. These experiences helped me realize that pure mechanical engineering wasn't quite the right fit for me.

Around this time, my PhD advisor introduced me to the fascinating world of Machine Learning. What started with a simple project—fine-tuning YOLOv4 to detect objects in a sketch of a bar mechanism—quickly grew into a passion. This project transformed into an interactive version, sparking my interest in designing my own neural network models and leading to the publication of several papers.</p>
            
These days, I enjoy building my own datasets and researching advancements in both Mechanical Engineering and Machine Learning, striving to merge these two fields in innovative ways. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work and interests!</p>

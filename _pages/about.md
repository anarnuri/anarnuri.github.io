Hi, I‚Äôm **Anar** ‚Äî a mechanical engineer turned machine learning researcher working at the intersection of AI and physical systems. I specialize in building end-to-end AI solutions that transition seamlessly from research to real-world deployment. Through my work at **Stony Brook University** and **Zortag**, I develop systems that bring intelligence to the edge ‚Äî whether on mobile devices or robotic arms.

### üî¨ Current Focus

My Ph.D. research explores **multi-modal generative models** for mechanical design. I work on neural architectures that synthesize mechanical mechanisms from scratch, combining domain-specific knowledge with powerful generative AI tools.

Some highlights of my research include:

- **üß† Dual-Decoder Transformer** for [mechanism synthesis](https://anarnuri.github.io/projects/9_project/), generating coupler curves and predicting joint coordinates with high accuracy.
- **üì± Mobile AI App** for [real-time object detection](https://anarnuri.github.io/projects/10_project/), deploying YOLOv8 on iPhone with automated robotic dataset generation (achieving 99.84% accuracy).
- **üìÑ Document RAG API** powered by [Llama-3-70B](https://anarnuri.github.io/projects/11_project/), enabling fast, private document-based Q&A.

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Build

My work blends algorithm design with system engineering. I take ideas from concept to deployment, optimizing for both performance and usability:

- Custom neural architectures: transformers, VAEs, diffusion models
- High-performance training using PyTorch Distributed + HPC clusters
- Edge-ready deployment on iOS, embedded systems, and robotic platforms

Technologies I‚Äôve engineered include:

- A **Transformer model** with a LLaMa2-style encoder and **diffusion-based decoder**
- A **conditional Œ≤-VAE** with Classifier-Free Guidance for controllable generation
- A **graph-VAE** for encoding structural relationships in mechanical linkages
- An **image-based VAE** + MLP pipeline to connect visual and geometric design
- Fine-tuned **Latent Diffusion Models** with **LoRA** and **quantization**
- A **GNN-based tokenizer** that transforms structured data into LLM-ready input

Many of these models are optimized for real-time inference and integrated into platforms like [MotionGen](https://motiongen.io).

### ü§ñ Industry Work

As a **Machine Learning Engineer at Zortag**, I program the **myCobot 280 PI** robotic arm to mimic human motion for dataset generation. I‚Äôve also fine-tuned **YOLOv8** for object detection and built a mobile app that brings these models to life, supporting:

- Real-time object detection on iPhone
- Instant QR code verification
- Seamless deployment of trained models to edge devices

### üìö More

I also developed a **production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API** that turns document sets into responsive knowledge bases. Built with:

- **Llama-3-70B** for advanced QA
- **FAISS** vector search + M2-BERT embeddings
- **AWS serverless infrastructure** for scalable, secure deployment

This system delivers intelligent answers in under **1.2 seconds**, with strict data privacy, and is freely accessible for academic or personal use.

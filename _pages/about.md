# Welcome to My Personal Website!

I’m **Anar**, a mechanical engineer turned machine learning enthusiast, with both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Stony Brook University. My journey in mechanical engineering started with hands-on internships at places like Flower Turbines, Chem3, and BP, but I discovered my real passion during grad school — **Machine Learning!** A project where I fine-tuned YOLOv4 to detect objects in a bar mechanism sketch sparked this shift, evolving from a simple task into an interactive tool and eventually leading to an exciting publication.

Currently, I’m a Ph.D. candidate and **Graduate Research Assistant** at Stony Brook, where my research focuses on designing innovative **multi-modal generative models** to push boundaries in mechanical engineering. I build my models from scratch, defining their architectures, custom loss functions, and training strategies. I’ve developed and deployed multiple models for path synthesis in mechanism design, which you can check out on [MotionGen](https://motiongen.io). These models include:

- A **Transformer model with a diffusion-based decoder**, replacing the conventional approach to enhance generative diversity and accuracy.
- A transformer-based model infused with LLaMa2 features for precise path generation.
- A conditional beta VAE with Classifier-Free Guidance for flexibility.
- A conditional graph-VAE for enhanced mechanism representation.
- An image-based VAE paired with an MLP to bridge latent spaces and mechanical designs.

One of my most significant contributions is the development of a **Dual-Decoder Transformer Model** for mechanism synthesis. This model processes coupler curve images and mechanism type embeddings to generate diverse and accurate designs. By leveraging two independent decoders, the model efficiently predicts joint coordinates, making it a breakthrough in path synthesis for complex mechanisms. This project not only showcases the potential of machine learning in mechanical design but also provides a scalable and versatile framework for engineering applications.

To accelerate my model training, I leverage **PyTorch** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, enabling me to train large-scale generative models efficiently.

In addition to my research, I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Zortag**, where I’m responsible for programming and automating the **myCobot 280 PI** robotic arm to capture images for dataset creation, significantly reducing manual effort by simulating human-like motion. I also fine-tune object detection models (like YOLOv8), improving detection accuracy and optimizing the data labeling pipeline.

Recently, I **developed an iPhone app** that allows my trained models to be deployed and inferenced on mobile devices. My model is **extremely fast**, running **in almost real-time**, making it highly efficient for practical applications where speed and accuracy are critical. This has significantly improved the feasibility of real-world deployment, allowing for **instant QR code verification** and **real-time object detection**.

Outside of work, I serve as **Head of the House Board** in Brooklyn. In this role, I lead a diverse group, overseeing responsibilities such as budgeting, maintenance, and conflict resolution, while fostering a collaborative environment. This experience has honed my leadership, communication, and organizational skills in managing both day-to-day operations and long-term planning.

I’ve also been busy **winning hackathons**—two in 2024! You can read more about these projects on my [Projects](https://anarnuri.github.io/projects/) page. Beyond technical work, I lead research projects end-to-end, enjoy building datasets (and sometimes my own robots!), and stay up-to-date with advancements in both mechanical engineering and machine learning. I’m comfortable with neural network architectures, custom loss functions, and tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, all while mentoring fellow researchers and sharing my work at ASME conferences.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects and experiences. Whether you’re here out of curiosity or looking to connect, I’m excited to share my journey with you!

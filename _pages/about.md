Welcome to my personal website!

I hold both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stony Brook University. My journey as a mechanical engineer began with internships at Flower Turbines, Chem3, and BP, where I gained hands-on experience in the field. However, it was during my graduate studies that I discovered my true passion—Machine Learning.

This shift was inspired by a project where I fine-tuned YOLOv4 to detect objects in a sketch of a bar mechanism. What started as a simple task evolved into an interactive tool, igniting my interest in designing neural network models and leading to the publication of several papers.

Currently, I serve as a Graduate Research Assistant at Stony Brook University, where I've designed four multi-modal generative models for path synthesis in mechanical engineering. These models include a transformer-based model with LLaMa2 features, a conditional beta VAE with cross-attention mechanisms, a conditional graph-VAE model, and an image-based VAE paired with an MLP for latent space mapping.

My work involves implementing object detection algorithms, leading end-to-end research projects, and managing datasets. I'm well-versed in neural network architectures, loss functions, and data manipulation tools such as PyTorch (Lightning), NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Additionally, I've presented my work at annual ASME conferences from 2021 to 2023.

I enjoy building my own datasets and researching the latest advancements in both Mechanical Engineering and Machine Learning, striving to merge these fields innovatively. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work and interests!

I’m Anar, a mechanical engineer turned machine learning enthusiast, with both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Stony Brook University. My journey in mechanical engineering started with hands-on internships at places like Flower Turbines, Chem3, and BP, but I discovered my real passion during grad school—Machine Learning! A project where I fine-tuned YOLOv4 to detect objects in a bar mechanism sketch sparked this shift, evolving from a simple task into an interactive tool and eventually leading to a few exciting publications.

Currently, I’m a Ph.D. candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at Stony Brook. My research focuses on designing innovative multi-modal generative models to push boundaries in mechanical engineering. I’ve developed and deployed four distinct models for path synthesis in mechanism design, which you can check out on MotionGen. These models include:

* A transformer-based model infused with LLaMa2 features for precise path generation.
* A conditional beta VAE with Classifier-Free Guidance for flexibility.
* A conditional graph-VAE for enhanced mechanism representation.
* An image-based VAE paired with an MLP to bridge latent spaces and mechanical designs.

In addition to research, I’ve been fine-tuning object detection and automation for practical applications, like reducing manual labor with a programmed robotic arm. I’ve also been busy winning hackathons—two in 2024! You can read more about these projects on my Projects page.

Beyond technical work, I lead research projects end-to-end, enjoy building datasets (and sometimes my own robots!), and stay up-to-date with advancements in both mechanical engineering and machine learning. I’m comfortable with neural network architectures, custom loss functions, and tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, all while mentoring fellow researchers and sharing my work at ASME conferences.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects and experiences. Whether you’re here out of curiosity or looking to connect, I’m excited to share my journey with you!

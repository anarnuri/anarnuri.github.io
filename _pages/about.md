I’m **Anar**, a mechanical engineer turned machine learning researcher, currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Stony Brook University. As a **Graduate Research Assistant**, my research focuses on designing and deploying innovative **multi-modal generative models** to tackle complex problems in mechanical engineering. I approach each project end-to-end—curating structured datasets, architecting custom neural networks, defining novel loss functions, and training models across distributed compute environments.

Some of the models I’ve developed and deployed include a **transformer-based architecture** with a LLaMa2-inspired encoder and **diffusion-based decoder** for precise mechanism synthesis, a **conditional β-VAE** with Classifier-Free Guidance for controllable generation, a **graph-VAE** for representing structural relationships, and an **image-based VAE** paired with an MLP to bridge visual and geometric design spaces. I’ve also fine-tuned **Latent Diffusion Models** using **LoRA** and **quantization**, incorporating a **GNN-based tokenizer** to encode structured data for direct LLM input.

All of these models are optimized for real-time inference and some are deployed on [MotionGen](https://motiongen.io). This full-stack, hands-on approach reflects my engineering mindset: rigorous, resourceful, and deeply committed to building practical and reliable AI systems from the ground up.

One of my most significant contributions is the development of a **Dual-Decoder Transformer Model** for mechanism synthesis. This model processes coupler curve images and mechanism type embeddings to generate diverse and accurate designs. By leveraging two independent decoders, it efficiently predicts joint coordinates, making it a breakthrough in path synthesis for complex mechanisms.

To accelerate model training, I use **PyTorch Distributed Training** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** resources, enabling efficient training of large-scale generative architectures.

In addition to my research, I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Zortag**, where I program and automate the **myCobot 280 PI** robotic arm for dataset generation, simulating human-like motion to reduce manual effort. I’ve also fine-tuned object detection models like **YOLOv8**, improving accuracy and speeding up the data labeling pipeline. Recently, I **developed an iPhone app** that deploys my trained models for near real-time inference. This significantly improves practical deployment by enabling **instant QR code verification** and **real-time object detection** on mobile devices.

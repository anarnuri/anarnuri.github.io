Welcome to my personal website!

I hold both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stony Brook University. My journey as a mechanical engineer began with internships at Flower Turbines, Chem3, and BP, where I gained hands-on experience in the field. However, it was during my graduate studies that I discovered my true passionâ€”Machine Learning.

This shift was inspired by a project where I fine-tuned YOLOv4 to detect objects in a sketch of a bar mechanism. What started as a simple task evolved into an interactive tool, igniting my interest in designing neural network models and leading to the publication of several papers.

Currently, I serve as a Graduate Research Assistant at Stony Brook University, where I've designed four multi-modal generative models for path synthesis in mechanical engineering. These models include a transformer-based model with LLaMa2 features, a conditional beta VAE with cross-attention mechanisms, a conditional graph-VAE model, and an image-based VAE paired with an MLP for latent space mapping.

My work involves implementing object detection algorithms, leading end-to-end research projects, and managing datasets. I'm well-versed in neural network architectures, loss functions, and data manipulation tools such as PyTorch (Lightning), NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Additionally, I've presented my work at annual ASME conferences from 2021 to 2023.

I enjoy building my own datasets and researching the latest advancements in both Mechanical Engineering and Machine Learning, striving to merge these fields innovatively. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work and interests!
